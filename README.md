# üìò VBA Module: Hyperlink Generator & Sheet Cleaner

### ‚úÖ **Why This Is Needed**

When working with long lists of file paths in Excel, you often need:

* Clickable hyperlinks to files or folders
* Clean worksheets free of unnecessary rows and columns
  Doing this manually is time-consuming and error-prone ‚Äî this macro automates the process.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **What It Does**

This module contains **3 macros**:

1. **`CreateHyperlink()`**

   * Converts the content of each selected cell (up to 2000 rows) into a hyperlink pointing to the same path.

2. **`CreateFolderHyperlink()`**

   * Converts file paths into hyperlinks pointing to their **parent folders** using a helper function `GetFolderpath()` (you need to define it).
   * Also replaces the cell content with the folder path.

3. **`DeleteRows()`**

   * Deletes all rows after row 1000 and all columns after column "Z" to reduce file size and improve performance.

### üìå **When to Use It**

Use this module when:

* You receive a list of file/folder paths and want to make them clickable.
* You need links to **folder locations**, not individual files.
* Your Excel file is bloated due to extra unused rows and columns.
* You want to streamline your workflow and improve Excel performance.
